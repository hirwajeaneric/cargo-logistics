# CARGO LOGISTIC
## Description
CARGO LOGISTICS is a web-based system that will allow people who want to send materials, and other properties between themselves to send and recieve them without moving from their homes or locations.

Users of the system will be filling in all the required information about what they want to send, and more details, where they are currently located, and when they want the cargo to be sent, where the reciever is located, and more other information.

As the user fills the form, they will also be provided with a payment system that they will be using to secure their order.

The system administrators who are the owners of the system will be recognizing that there is a request sent by a user, and therefore go get the cargo and transport it to the destination address.

After the cargo reaches the destination, the sender will be notified about the success of the transportation.
