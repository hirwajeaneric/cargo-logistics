# EXPRESS LOGISTICS
## System Overview.

EXPRESS Logistics is a web-based system that allows people to send, and recieve whatever movable properties and materials between themselves in any location around the world.

Users of the system will be filling in all the required information about what they want to send, and more details, where they are currently located, the reciever's address, and more other information to facilitate the transfer.

As the user fills out the form, they will also be provided with a payment system form that they will use to secure their order.

The system administrators who are the manager's of the system in the company will be recognizing that there is a request sent by a user, and therefore go get the cargo and transport it to the specified destination.

After the cargo reaches the destination, the send will be notified about the success of the transfter.
